      <b>K-means algorithm</b> is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition
      the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups
      (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to
      make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also
      keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible. It assigns data
      points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the
      data points and the clusterâ€™s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data
      points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. The less variation
      we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points
      are within the same cluster.

    <Typography variant="body1">
      Centroids play a key role in the k-means algorithm. Centroids are data
      points that determine the cluster a given data point belongs to. You will
      understand why it's called centroid in a later step. Each cluster has a
      single centroid. They are assigned <b>randomly a data point</b> from the
      bunch of data points initially.

      Step 2: Determine the cluster
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      We take data points one by one and determine which cluster they belong to.
      Lets first take a single data point (it will be a yellow circle). Then we
      determine the distance between this point and all other centroids one by
      one. The current point belongs to the cluster whose centroid is closest to
      this point.

    <Typography variant="body1">
      In this step we will update the centroids. We update each centroid by
      finding the "geometrical Centroid" of the data points which belong to the
      same cluster as determined in the previous step.The dashed arrow shows the
      shift of each centroid.

      Step 4: Iteration
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      We iterate through the last two steps ,i.e find the cluster to which each
      data point belongs with respect to the centroid, update values of the
      centroid and so on. We iterate till the stage when the centroids of the
      clusters doesn't change even after updation. Congratulations! We have come
      to the end.
