      <b>K-means algorithm</b> is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition
      the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups
      (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It tries to
      make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also
      keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible. It assigns data
      points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the
      data points and the clusterâ€™s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data
      points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. The less variation
      we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points
      are within the same cluster.
